# Telegram Millionaire Game

This project contains a small web game that mimics "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire". The repository now includes a Jest based test suite.

## Running the tests

Install dependencies once:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the Jest suite:

```bash
npm test
```

The test environment uses JSDOM to simulate the game DOM and verify behaviours of `MillionaireGame`.
